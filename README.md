# Real-Estate-API
Python EDA from data acquired from a public real estate API

The API I used was the US Realty API provided by APIdojo.net. located at https://rapidapi.com/apidojo/api/realty-in-us/. The API is accessed through the basic subscription which allows 500 pulls/month with a limit of 5 pulls/second. Anyone accessing the code in this repo should get their own key from the above link, to avoid exceeding my pull limit. Alternately I will provide the csv file with same data acquired via the API

This is an ongoing project that I will continue to add to as I have more time. The initial intent is to do some basic cleaning and EDA; ultimately, I intend to apply some Machine Learning algorithms to draw further insights from the data.
